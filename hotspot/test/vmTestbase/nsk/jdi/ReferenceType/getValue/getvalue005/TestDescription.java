 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks that the JDI method
 *        com.sun.jdi.ReferenceType.getValue()
 *     properly throws IllegalArgumentException for non-static field.
 *     The exception is provoked to be thrown by getting a Value of:
 *         - protected non-static field;
 *         - private non-static field;
 *         - package non-static field (default access);
 *         - public non-static field.
